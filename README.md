You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## What to do

List of the various features that you can implements. You can apply any strategy you want:
- Catch low hanging fruits
- Make only 1 or 2
- Add and define others

Please note, you have max 1h in total. Therefore, you have to choose which feature(s) you implement and which one you don't.

### *Select items*

You can select one or many items using a checkbox per item.

### *Multiple (un)selection using groups*

You can (un)select one or many groups using a checkbox per group.
When you (un)select a group, this (un)selects all items as well.

### *Smart group (un)select*

When all items for a group are selected, select the group as well.

When at least 1 item isn't selected from a group, unselect the group.

### *Search*

Add a search that filter result regarding the input of the user. Display only content with matching content.

### *Filter*

Add capatibilities to filter result using:
- Alphabetical order A->Z / Z->A
- Amount LOWER -> GREATER / GREATER -> LOWER
- any other sort function

## How to do

- This challenge should set a focus on the logical programming part rather than graphical one. Therefore, a version without any CSS is a valid solution.
- Pay attention to clearly use comments when necessary.
- Keep track of the time you are spending. You shouldn't spend more than 1h in total.
- You can implements as few / many features as you want.
- If you modify a specific feature or assume something, clearly comments your points.
- At the end, send me _via email_ all files that are relevants
